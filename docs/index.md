# Introduction

With this extension you can give constituents access to their CiviCRM data without them needing a Drupal account.

This extension has been created with the following use case in mind: Let people read and change their contact
data in a drupal webform. To access the data, people need to enter their email address. A link to the prefilled
webform will be sent to that email address if and only if the email address exists within CiviCRM.
